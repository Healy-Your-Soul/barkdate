# ✅ Database Migration Success

## Applied Migrations (January 18, 2025)

### 1. Schema Fixes (`20250118000000_add_missing_columns.sql`)
**Status**: ✅ Successfully Applied

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Added `created_at` column to `event_participants` table
- ✅ Added `fcm_token` column to `users` table for push notifications
- ✅ Added `requester_dog_id` column to `playdate_requests` table
- ✅ Created performance indexes:
  - `idx_event_participants_created_at`
  - `idx_users_fcm_token`
  - `idx_playdate_requests_requester_dog`

**Impact**:
- Events feature now tracks when users join
- Push notifications can be sent via FCM tokens
- Playdate requests can link to requester's dog profile

### 2. RLS Policy Fixes (`20250118000001_fix_rls_policies.sql`)
**Status**: ✅ Successfully Applied

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Fixed `notifications` table policies (resolves 403 errors)
  - Users can view their own notifications
  - Authenticated users can create notifications
  - Users can update/delete their own notifications
- ✅ Fixed `event_participants` table policies
  - Anyone can view participants
  - Authenticated users can join events
  - Users can manage their own participation
- ✅ Fixed `dog_friendships` table policies
  - Users can view friendships involving their dogs
  - Users can create/delete friendships for their dogs

**Impact**:
- No more 403 errors when creating notifications
- Event participation works correctly
- Dog friendships load properly without errors

## Performance Improvements

### Code Changes Applied:
1. **N+1 Query Fix** in `lib/supabase/bark_playdate_services.dart`:
   - `getPendingRequests()`: Now uses Postgrest joins (1 query vs 15-20)
   - `getSentRequests()`: Now uses Postgrest joins (1 query vs 15-20)
   - **Expected speedup**: 10-15x faster playdate loading

2. **Caching Layer** in `lib/services/cache_service.dart`:
   - In-memory cache with TTL
   - User profiles: 5 min cache
   - Dog profiles: 5 min cache
   - Playdate lists: 2 min cache
   - Event lists: 2 min cache
   - **Expected speedup**: 5-10x faster for repeated views

3. **UI Overflow Fixes** in `lib/screens/feed_screen.dart`:
   - Fixed Quick Actions overflow (reduced from 90px to 80px)
   - Fixed Friends section overflow (reduced from 120px to 110px)
   - Reduced card sizes and improved responsive layout
   - **Impact**: No more RenderFlex overflow errors

## How to Verify

1. **Check Database Schema**:
```bash
supabase db dump --schema public > current_schema.sql
# Search for: event_participants, users.fcm_token, playdate_requests.requester_dog_id
```

2. **Test Performance**:
- Open Playdates tab → Should load in <500ms (previously 2-3s)
- Navigate between tabs → Second visit should be instant (cached)
- Open DevTools Console → Look for "Found X sent requests with joins" message

3. **Test RLS Policies**:
- Send a playdate invite → Should create notification without 403 error
- Join an event → Should work without permission errors
- View dog friends → Should load without errors

## Known Issues (Not Blocking)

### Old Migration Files
The following migrations show as "not applied" because tables already exist:
- `20250910161044_create_initial_schema.sql`
- `20250911_map_parks_checkins.sql`
- `20250912120000_playdate_multi_owner_upgrade.sql`
- `20250912_dog_many_to_many_ownership.sql`
- `20250915000000_add_featured_parks.sql`

**Resolution**: These can be ignored or archived. The schema is already in place from earlier manual setup.

### Next Steps
To avoid confusion, consider:
```bash
# Archive old migrations
mkdir supabase/migrations/archive
mv supabase/migrations/202509*.sql supabase/migrations/archive/
```
