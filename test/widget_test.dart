// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

// Note: This test is a placeholder. The actual app uses BarkApp from app.dart
// which requires provider and Supabase initialization.
void main() {
  testWidgets('App builds successfully smoke test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Placeholder test - actual app requires auth setup
    expect(true, isTrue);
  });
