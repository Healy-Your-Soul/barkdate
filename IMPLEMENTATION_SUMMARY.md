### Database Schema Fixes

3. **Foreign Key Updates**: Changed park_id to text type to avoid dependency issues

### Code Fixes
1. **Duplicate Method**: Removed duplicate `_loadCheckInStatus()` in feed_screen.dart

3. **Postgrest API**: Fixed `.eq()` chaining issues for newer Postgrest version
4. **RPC Calls**: Updated to use `params:` named parameter

### Compilation Errors Resolved
- ✅ Undefined 'CheckInService' → Added import

## 🐕 Dog-Centric Philosophy

The entire app now operates from the dog's perspective:
- Dogs are the primary users
- Humans are referred to as "My Human"
- All actions are from the dog's point of view
- Notifications and messages maintain dog-first language
- Profile hierarchy: Dog profile is primary, human info is secondary

This creates a unique, playful, and engaging user experience that sets BarkDate apart from other pet social apps!
